# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :
This project is a Real-Time Chat Application built using Node.js and Socket.IO that enables multiple users to communicate instantly without refreshing the page. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is served through Live Server, while the backend runs on Node.js and manages real-time communication using WebSockets via Socket.IO. Users can join the chat, send and receive messages in real time, and get notified when other users connect or disconnect. This project demonstrates effective frontend and backend integration, real-time data handling, and the use of WebSocket technology, making it suitable for internship submissions and learning real-time web application development.
